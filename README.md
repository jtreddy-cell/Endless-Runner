My Endless Runner will be cat themed. The player would play as a cat running through a endlessly long house. The score will go up with time, and can be increased in two ways. The first will be by picking up treats, which will increase the score by a constant amount. The second will be by picking up catnip, which speeds up the game for 10 seconds, increasing difficulty but also the passive score gained by time passing.

My current plan is to implement the code first, using placeholders boxes for the graphics, then create actual assets. List will get updated as I realize what else I need to do later, I have no idea how extensive this will end up being.
